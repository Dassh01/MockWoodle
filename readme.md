# -Mock Woodle-
## APCSA Project #4
Felt like this project was big enough to have its own repo <br>
Designed to act like https://play.woodle.today

The session word (word which you are trying to guess) is randomly selected from the file "words". It is hardcoded to "lolly" by default, but any number of 5-letter words can be entered. (All lowercase and each new word on a new line)

Commands can be found by typing -cmds
